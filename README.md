# DTSA 5511 Final Project

## Project Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. This is a revolutionary application of deep learning that has the potential to diagnose diseases in the early stages, which can save countless lives. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning architecture that has shown significant success in image analysis. CNNs can learn to automatically extract features from the images and make predictions based on those features. Therefore, it is the ideal model choice for this use case.

## Data Overview
The data used for this project was collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data) and contains small pathology images to classify. In total, the training data contains roughly 220k images and their respective labels, and the test data contains 57.5k unlabeled images.

## Results & Conclusions
